# What is MyUniPerformance.github.io?

As part of the Capstone Course Project I worked on for my Bachelor's degree, my team and me had to set up a website that would contain all the necessary information to describe the project we created. It's pretty basic and not very exciting but it's funtional and was a good primer to learn more about how github.io works.
