 <h1> What is MyUniPerformance? </h1>
<p>Our team decided to create a platform by and for students to help them keep track of their academic performance and progress. Our focus also extends to the relationship between students and educators so they can help eachother out and improve the college experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-problem">
 <div class="section-problem-statement">
  <h3> Problem </h3>
<p>Some universities donâ€™t have tools to help students plan their academic progress in a better way. Of course, there are numerous free tools that perform tasks such as GPA calculation, but they lack functionality beyond that. There exist fewer possibilities where the user might be enrolled in a second major, or they might be undertaking a minor degree. There are also tools to see feedback from professors with whom the students would like to take a class, but these tools often do not provide specific feedback based on a certain course and section. Finally, many students would like to compare their performance relative to that of the peers in their class, to know if they are on the right track throughout their academic career. However, there is no public platform that allows us to extrapolate data anonymously from people that have taken the same courses as the student.</p>
</div>

 <div class="section-problem-solution">
 <h3> Solution </h3>
<p>Based on the academic characteristics that our university community requires so that they can be better equipped to have a successful college experience, it was determined that the following features will be necessary for the system-to-be:</p>

<ul>
 <li> <b>Student curriculum viewer:</b>  We will provide the student user with an interactive curriculum element (provided by them or their university) which will have the capability to be sorted across years and semesters. This element will allow the student to view particular information about course sections listed, the educators that teached that section, and simple information about said educators.</li>

 <li> <b>Course details and feedback:</b>  We will provide the student user with an extensive and informative view of a specific course, which will also contain the overall rating over time (given by the student users) as well as various ways to interpret statistics of said course. These statistics are mostly of a filtering nature (by educator, year, section, grades, etc). Additionally, the student user will be able to give constructive feedback on a particular section in which they will provide both criticisms and praises; this is useful for the student's preparation and the professor's introspecton.</li>

 <li> <b>Student performance reviewer:</b> When students get their course grades and enter them into the system, they will be able to compare their performance relative to that of other students in the course anonymously. This will allow them to see if they are on the right track, academically, relative to their classmates. They will be able to evaluate the performance based on different criterias, such as, for example, extrapolating all the historical data anonymously of all the students who have taken that course previously or making a comparison based on the students who took that course in the same semester, since it would adapt more to the circumstances of that moment.</li>
  </ul>
